 This contains the EventTag version for the bean,
 augmented with a class DecayTable to store the decay table as a text.
 
 DecayTable contains:
 *) variables:
    decays: table string with final particles -> number of decays
            this is "global" table one per job
    vecdes: vector with decay products (pdg-codes) of studied
            particle; this variable may change for each event
    ntot:   total number of decays
 *) functions:
    Size():   size of table
    Reset():  clear vecdec
    StrDec(): convert vecdec to string with pdg names
    Add():    fill in the table according to the decay stored
              in the vecdec
    Print(min_percent):
              print table sorted by percentage of each decay
              up to min_percent
